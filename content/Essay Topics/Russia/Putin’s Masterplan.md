### Putin’s “miscalculation”
source: [Putin’s miscalculation](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/blog-post/putins-miscalculations)
1. Underestimation of the West's reaction to the war against Ukraine
2. Russia's misperception of the situation on the ground
3. Overestimation of the condition of the Russian army

### Putin’s Playbook
source: [[A Brutal Russian Playbook Reapplied in Ukraine]]
- Reminisce about checnya → territory in southern Russia that declare independence from Moscow as the Soviet Union was dissolving. Russian army twice invaded the capital and twice flattened it also.
- Important to note because chechnya has became Russia’s blueprint in conquering territories.
#### How Chechen went down
- The War in Chechnya began with a shocking display of Russin incompetence.
- Russian troops were met by civilian chechen fighters
- Russian Army moved to strike Chechen via air and artillery

**What this means:** Russia is using the same tactics now in Ukraine, as they did in Chechen.
#### The next phase
If Putin is following the same playbook as he did in Chechen:
- Russia will not play “clean” → They will unleash air power and try to Disseminate Ukraine.
- Russia empowered local rebels and used them to their advantage in Chechen.
	*“Six years into the war, Mr. Putin turned the chief mufti of Chechnya to betray the rebel cause. The mufti’s son, Ramzan Kadyrov, became Mr. Putin’s chief henchman and has supplied Chechen fighters to support Russian forces in the wars in Syria and now Ukraine.”*
- Russia is already doing this in Ukraine: arrests of local officials, detentions and threats against local journalists.
