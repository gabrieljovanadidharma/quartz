# Paris Agreement
International treaty in [[climate change]] adopted in 2015.

> ## Aims of the treaty: 
> - keep the rise in global temperature well below 2 °C above pre-industrial levels. -> Emissions should be reduced as soon as possible and reach net-zero by mid-century
> - Increasing the ability to adapt to the adverse impacts of climate change and foster climate resilience and low greenhouse gas emissions development, in a manner that does not threaten food production;
> - Making finance flows consistent with a pathway towards low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development.

## System of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC)
- Contributions to the Paris Agreement are determined by the countries themselves, but requires ambitious efforts" towards "achieving the purpose of this Agreement" and to "represent a progression over time" -> Article 3
- The Contributions should be set every 5 years -> Ratcheting Mechanism (see: Footnote of [[COP 26]])
- Does not clearly define the exact nature of NDC
	```ad-tip
	title: Reflection
	Is this a good thing? -> means that the countries can use the Paris agreement as a facade.
	
	But also -> Climate Change disproportionately impacts developing countries -> they (developing countries) doesn't need to contribute as much
	```
- There are procedures to ensure preparedness of NDC commitments (a new one every five years, provide information about the implementation.)

## Structure
- **Bottom-Up** -> NDC system allows nations to set their own goal, rather than habing targets imposed top-down
Why -> encourages climate goals rather than bounding legally.
- Emphasize the principle of *Common but Differentiated Responsibility and Respective Capabilities* –acknowledgement that different nations have different capacities and duties to climate action– However, does not provide a specific distinction between developed and developing nations.
