# Glasgow Climate Pact
Aim -> Staving off dangerous [[climate change]]

- Basically reaffirms and build upon the [[Paris Agreement]]'s goal of holding the increase in global temperature below 2°C 
- Recognizes that limiting global warming to 1,5°C requires extensive sustained reduction in global green house emissions.
- Aims to reduce global carbon-dioxide emissions by 45% relative to 2010 level. -> Achieving this is **not ensured**; with the current pledges, emissions in 2030 will be 14% higher than in 2010.
- Explicitly mentions **coal** as a factor of climate change that needs to be **phased-down** -> not **phased-out**
- over 100 countries pledges to reverse deforestation by 2030
- over 140 countries pledges to reach net-zero emissions (90% of the global gdp)
- That developed countries **must** increase funding to nations already suffering the effects of climate change

### The Breakthroughs:
-   Clean power the most affordable and reliable option for all countries to meet their power needs efficiently by 2030. 
-   Zero-emission vehicles the new normal. They need to be accessible, affordable and sustainable in all regions by 2030. 
-   Near-zero emission steel the preferred choice in global markets, with efficient use and near-zero emission steel production established and growing in every region by 2030. 
-   Affordable renewable and low carbon hydrogen globally available by 2030. 
-   Climate-smart, sustainable agriculture the most attractive and widely adopted option for farmers everywhere by 2030.

> “This is a fragile win. We can now say that we have kept 1.5°C degrees alive. But its pulse is weak and it will only survive if we keep our promises and translate commitments into rapid action,”
\- Alok Sharma, *president of COP26.*
