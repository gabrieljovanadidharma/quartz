# Russo-Ukrainian Crisis
#russia #ukraine
### Motion: Intake 1
Russia has been amassing forces along its border with Ukraine in the past weeks. While Putin's intention has not been explicitly stated, security analysts suggest that the decision is to prevent Ukraine from joining NATO. This goal may be achieved by either intimidating Ukraine and NATO with military threats or invading Ukraine if necessary. Russia is particularly concerned with this issue since it fears that the US and its allies would place intermediate- and short-range missiles in Ukraine, thereby enabling them to launch attack to Russia's territory directly. 

> Do you agree with Putin's approach to preserve Russia's national security? Why? 
> How should the international community preserve peace and stability in this crisis?

## PUTIN’S MASTERPLAN
see: [[Putin’s Masterplan]]
### Going Forward 
#### Resolving The Issue
**Main Priority**: Deescalation -> diplomatic means
 - Why deescalation?
The current invasion is basically a semi-[[proxy war]] between the West and Russia. The threat of nuclear warfare is imminent without a serious focus on deescalation.

**How** → get the US involved in the Negotiation table

With the threat of a nuclear holocaust, it is the utmost importance that two nuclear possessing countries do not go to war head-to-head. As history have taught us, a nuclear war never ends well. The [[Cold War]] only ends because one of the country dissolved.
