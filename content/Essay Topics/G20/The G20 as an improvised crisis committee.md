# Body
- The G20 has become the premier forum for global economic governance after the 2008 ‘Great Recession’ → This has been effective
- G20 can be a new ‘Steering Committee’ beacuse of its membership reach (beyond the post-1945 hegemonic powers)
- The Innovative Quality of the G20 rests on two test of qualities:
	1. G20 as a proverbial ‘recession-buster’
	2. The success of G20 in making the regulatory regime rigt.

## The G20 as both a contested and a necessary vehicle for change
- G20 is very ‘exclusive’ → members are self-selected like the G7/G8
- Bias towards big members at the expense of other countries
- **G20 Through Realism:**
	- G20 is a new and updated concentration of power → Unlike G7/8, G20 includes emerging powers such as China and India
	- G20 is different in that it diverges in comparative historical experiences, regime types, and conceptualization of global order
- The G20 is an ongoing project without a strict process → In contrast to the UN, G20’s speed of decission making is remarkable.

## Improvised Crisis Diplomacy
- G20 is framed as an impromptu forum formed because of International crisis (e.g. The Great Recession of 2008)
- Guido Mantega, Finance Minister of Brazil in 2008 stated:
 > “*there is no agile structure prepared to deal with emergency economic provlems. That is waht we have seen at this time… We have to turn this G20 into a forum or a tool of some kind that can provide answes to immediate problems and coordinate its actions better amongst many countries. We are facing the most serious financial crisis perhaps since the crisis of 1929, and as this crisis is getting more serious it demands quick answers, immediate answers. It must be monitored day by day, hour by hour, so that the necessary measures can be taken to handle the problems that arise. So there must be very agile instruments available for that to happen*“
 
## Competing Interpretations of Global Governance
- Ideational pressure has been mounting for the G20 to vecome a new ‘steering committee’ for global governance
- American Think-Tankers has argued that the G20 had become ‘an effective steering committee for the world economy’
- Adaptablility is the key ingredient.
### Critiques:
- Idealistically, the move towards the G20 is at the expense of the UN and univeralism. The G20 can be seen as a way to bypass the UN.
	- UN Secretary General stated the need for ‘inclusive multilateralism’ to protect the well-being of the developing countries, as well as UN development goals.
- The rise of the G20 constituted a power grab by the ‘big’ club insiders at the expense of smaller non-members.
	- Anders Åslund argues that by arrogating decision-making power to itself, the G20 ‘emasculates the sovereign rights of small countries that have long been the prime defenders of multilateralism and international law as well as the foremost policy innovators. The rule of the big powers over the rest is in danger of becoming unjust and reactionary.’
- Singapore pioneered the [[Global Governance Group]]
- The UN secretary general supported mobilization against the G20. George Yeo, Singapore’s foreign minister, commented:
	> The UN Secretary Ban Ki Moon supports our initiative and I think he should play a bigger role in those G20 meetings because he represents all of us. The G20 should not be exclusivist in its approach when it convenes meetings on particular areas of interest and must include other countries by using variable geometry for different subjects so that different countries can attend. 
- Anders Åslund sees the G20 as a new form of centralized control and command with a high degree of global authority.

## Looking Into the Future
- The G20 has passed the first tests in synchronized fashion. Despite debates about definitional issues, a striking degree of coordination was established concerning national and international stimulus packages
