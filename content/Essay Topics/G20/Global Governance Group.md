## On the Global Governance Group (3G) and Singapore
paper: [[Global_governance_group.pdf]]
**Conclusion**:
Kishore Mahbubani, former president of the UN Security Council, has urged America to now show a decent respect for the opinions of mankind. He argued that the West must gracefully give up its dominance of global institutions, from the IMF to the World Bank. International relations, like nature, hates vacuum; that in the space created by the West’s withdrawal, ‘the rest’, particularly Asia are **slowly but inexorably moving in.**

As with the G3, Asia, not only the emerging massive power like China or India but also smaller countries such as Singapore, Taiwan, and Hong Kong has showed its appetite for a showing in the International Stage. But, with this understanding, comes some responsibilities –small to begin with– One can be small but significant.

## Global Governance Group as a Balance for the G20
Article : [Re-Balancing the G-20 from Efficiency to Legitimacy](https://www.jstor.org/stable/24526279)
- The 3G Noted that there “*was a problem with the G20 becaise it was making decisions that impacted the broader UN membership, and that was unfair to thoese outside as these countries had no impact on the G20 decisions*”
- Many of the critique for the G20 has pushed for its expansion as a resolvement. However, Singapore found a different way. Singapore has sought a way to build a more equitable relationship between the G20 and the G172(non- G20 Countries)
- The 3G proved to hold a respectable amount of Political Capital; as the non-G20 countries will likely not buy into G20 initiatives if it is not representative of their interest.
- The 3G is instituted in such a way that facilitates fluidness. e.g. if the G20 is talking about agriculture, then we need Uruguay. If the G20 is talking about stability then we need Chile.

### The 3G Position and Substance
**Keyword:** Bringing legitimacy and efficiency together

- Argued that “power itself confers legitimacy”, therefore the 3G has proposed a few measure to **enhance** engagement between the G20 and non-G20 member countries such as:
	- Before future summits, the G20 should hold consultations with non-G20 members through regular and predictable channels
	- The G20 should provide updates about preparations and outcomes to the UN → Formalization of the Participation of the UN.
	- The G20 should arrange for the participation of non-G20 members in discussion of specialized issues.
	- The G20 should include the participation of established regional organizations (APEC, ASEAN, African Union Comission, NEPAD)
- Main goal → to forge a G20-UN Relationship that is complementary rather than competing or contradictory.
- Founding Principles of the G20:
	- to Confer greater legitimacy to the G20 process
	- to act as a bridge linking G20 and UN membership
	- to ensure that the G20 hears the voices of non-members
