 ### Motion: Intake 1
COP26 in Glasgow, 31 October-13 November produced the 'Glasgow Climate Pact', in which states pledge to phase down coal power, reverse deforestation, and achieve net-zero emissions. However, despite this apparent commitment, activists argued that the document was mostly “symbolic”. The pact was also criticised for not doing enough for limiting the global temperature increase to 1.5 C above the pre-industrial levels.

>Do you agree with the criticism against the COP26? Why? 
>What should the international community do to tackle the threats of climate change?

# Criticism of COP 26
## 1. Last-Minute Coal-Related Revision
India and China called for nations to “phase down” rather than “phase out” use of the dirtiest fossil fuel.

## 2. Loss and Damage Funds
> “(I’ve) come here with a single agenda which is to help the poorest people on the planet who are already suffering from the impacts of human-induced climate change. And we needed a Glasgow facility on loss and damage finance here. 138 developing countries put language in the text yesterday. It got removed overnight. It’s not there any more. It has been replaced by an offer for a dialogue … absolutely disappointing and totally unacceptable.”
